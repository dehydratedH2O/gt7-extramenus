Gran Turismo 7 v1.17 - Extra Menus Exploit

Inspired by: https://github.com/ByPrinciple/GT7-Scripts

IMPORTANT:

For Educational purposes only. I am not responsible for any damages such as getting banned, doing something unintended on your system, or any other unintended side effect. Use this at your own risk. This script only automates what any human would do, it does not exploit any code at all.

## WORK IN PROGRESS!
- This was quickly put together, there is barely any testing, so run it at your own risk. Feel free to modify the script to your liking.

## Instructions (Windows only)

- Install PS Remote Play and set up Remote Play with your console.
- Clone the repository
- Install python and the necessary modules: `pyautogui`, `pillow`, `opencv-python`
- Run the script from an elevated command prompt. Otherwise, pyautogui will not capture the PS Remote Play screen.
- PS Remote Screen must be on your primary monitor. Make sure the center of the screen is directly on top of the PS Remote Play window. You want it to avoid capturing the terminal window.
- Make sure the first reward you get is the 4-star ticket. (The script starts there). If not, manually do the Rotary engine ticket before starting the script.
- Profit!

## Features

- Automatically detects what type of reward you get form the 4-star tickets to determine what keys to press to continue the exploit.
